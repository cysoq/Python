# py2app #

Allows a python script to be compiled and turned into a portable Mac application 

How to install
```
$ pip install -U py2app
```

How to use:
1. Navigate to the folder holding the application you want to use and run the following to create a setup.py (Which will allow the creation to be customized)
```
$ py2applet --make-setup MyApplication.py
```
See file
```Python
"""
This is a setup.py script generated by py2applet
 
Usage:
    python setup.py py2app
"""
 
from setuptools import setup
 
APP = ['MyApplication.py']
DATA_FILES = []
OPTIONS = {}
 
setup(
    app=APP,
    data_files=DATA_FILES,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)
```
+ Can make changes such as including:
  +  Data_files: `1DATA_FILES = ['myfile.json', 'myfile.txt']`
  + icon image: `OPTIONS = {'iconfile':'image.ico'}`
}

2. Now compile project in `Alias` mode to check if it works correctly, will only work on this machine. See in side the dist folder
```
$ python setup.py py2app -A
```

3. Once you verified it works, remove the first build alias
```
rm -rf build dist
```

4. Now can build the application 
```
$ python3 setup.py py2app
```
