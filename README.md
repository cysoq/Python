# Why Python? #

In school most of my time is spent in learning more complicated aspects of computer science, mostly in c and c++

What I needed to learn was how to quickly make scripts to create tools, automation, and short term solutions outside of school. Python and its libraries allows for the fastest implementation, so I made an effort to understand it well.
